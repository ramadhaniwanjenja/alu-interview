Rainwater Retention Calculator This project contains a Python program that calculates the total amount of rainwater that can be retained between walls represented by a list of non-negative integers.

Requirements The first line of all files must be #!/usr/bin/python3. Code must adhere to PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x). No modules should be imported. All functions must be documented. All files must be executable. Functionality The main function, rain(walls), computes the total square units of water that can be trapped between walls of varying heights.

Prototype python Copy code def rain(walls): Parameters walls (List[int]): A list of non-negative integers representing the heights of the walls. Returns int: The total amount of rainwater retained. Example Usage python Copy code if name == "main": walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4] print(rain(walls)) # Output: 6

walls = [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
print(rain(walls))  # Output: 6
